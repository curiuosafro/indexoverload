          <p> Lorem ipsum, or <strong><em>lipsum</em></strong> as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:  </p>
          <!--Some search for gold but tom & jerry spent it all fighting-->
          <p> The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without <em>controversy</em>, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.  </p>
